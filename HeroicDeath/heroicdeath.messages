#This file contains custom messages for death events.
#You can specify as many messages as you want (within reason) for each death type.
#Just be sure each message is on a new line under the appropriate label.
#When a player dies, a random message from the appropriate label is chosen.
#Accepted variables:
# - %d holds the name of the dead player.
# - %a holds the name of the attacking entity (player or monster) for PVP and Monster deaths.
# - %i holds the name of the attacking player's current item for PVP deaths.
#Custom item names may be defined in the 'heroicdeath.items' file.
