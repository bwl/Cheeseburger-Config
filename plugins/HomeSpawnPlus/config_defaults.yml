# This config_defaults.yml is NOT USED by HSP in any way and is
# overwritten everytime HSP starts up. It is simply here for reference
# to the full set of options available in HSP as well as their
# default values. Copy any sections you want here into your config.yml
# to make changes.

# This defines which permission system HSP uses. Vault and WEPIF
# (WEPIF is built into WorldEdit) are preferred, they both provide
# a nice interface to all other permission systems. If you don't have
# or don't want to use either of those, there is some native support
# for a few other permission systems that you can use. These are
# checked in the order they are listed for existence, and the
# first one to match is used.
permissions:
  - vault
  - wepif
  - pex
  - perm2-compat
  - superperms
  - ops

  # EBEANS - Ebeans storage (will go to SqlLite or MySQL, as defined
  #     by bukkit.yml)
  # YAML - YAML storage in your plugins/HomeSpawnPlus directory.
  #     Will store one file per data type (home, spawn, etc).
  # YAML_SINGLE_FILE - YAML storage in your plugins/HomeSpawnPlus
  #     directory. Stores all data in single "data.yml" file.
  # PERSISTANCE_REIMPLEMENTED_EBEANS - use persitance reimplemented
  #     ebeans implementation. Exactly like EBEANS above except with
  #     a few extra benefits. http://goo.gl/rtdDH  To live-reload
  #     with this, due to a Bukkit limitation, you must edit
  #     plugin.yml and set 'database: false'
  #
  # This is one option that cannot be reloaded live with "/hsp rc",
  # you must restart Bukkit if you change this option.

  # this is ONLY used when "ops" is used in the "permissions" section

  bedsethome: true

  # If true, HSP will require 2 clicks on the bed to set the home. This
  # avoids accidentally setting your bedhome when you don't mean to.
  bedhome2clicks: true

  # If true, HSP will require it be night time in order for a bed home
  # to be saved by clicking on it. (ie. single player mechanics)
  bedHomeMustBeNight: false

  # If set to true, the player will never see the "You can only
  # sleep at night" message. Be warned this has the unfortunate side
  # effect that they can never actually sleep in their bed, either.
  bedHomeNeverDisplayNightMessage: false

  # This restores the "original" behavior where all bed clicks go
  # through (instead of supressing the first in 2click mode), which
  # makes it possible to night sleep on first click and set home on
  # 2 clicks. Note this is also possible without this option by

  # Event priority; the basic assumption is that you want HSP to

  # for some reason.

  # HSP has a notion of "default home" which the player can change

  #   ORIGINAL: use HSP's original algorithm, which first checks
  #     HSP's database for any record, then falls back to a
  #     PLAYER_DAT check. This can be faster since it's a cached
  #     DB lookup instead of a file access, but it also means that
  #     you can't test "new player" strategies simply by removing
  #     the player.dat file.

  # If enabled, "safe teleport" will be used for any teleport
